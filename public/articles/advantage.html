    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Most professionals believe that career growth is purely a matter of hard work and technical expertise. Yet, time and again, it’s been proven that mindsets, habits, and beliefs play a much larger role. The silent roadblocks are not the market, the industry, or the lack of jobs — but the myths people carry in their heads.</p>
    <p>This article uncovers the most damaging myths and replaces them with truths that empower professionals to take charge of their journey.</p>

  <section id="myths">
    <h2>The Most Common Career Myths</h2>
    <p>Let’s look at the most widespread myths that have stalled countless professionals:</p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Myth 1:</strong> “It’s too late to change careers.”  
      <em>Truth:</em> Professionals in their 30s, 40s, and even 50s have made successful transitions into entirely new industries.
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Myth 2:</strong> “Only technical skills matter.”  
      <em>Truth:</em> Employers prioritize soft skills — leadership, communication, and adaptability often outweigh certifications.
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Myth 3:</strong> “Career breaks ruin opportunities.”  
      <em>Truth:</em> With the right narrative, breaks can be reframed as times of learning, personal development, or resilience.
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Myth 4:</strong> “Networking is luck-based.”  
      <em>Truth:</em> Networking is a structured process that can be learned, practiced, and leveraged intentionally.

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Career myths are like invisible chains — they restrict possibilities without individuals even realizing it. The good news is that these myths are not facts. With the right mindset and resources, every professional can rewrite their career story.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, your career is not limited by age, breaks, or labels — it is defined by how courageously you act in the present.</p>
